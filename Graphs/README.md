This is a test change to the README.md file.

A graph data structure consists of the following:

graph

- has an array called vertices
- has an array called edges

edge

- has a vertex called from
- has a vertex called to

vertex

- has an array of edges called edgesOut
- has an array of edges called edgesIn

Challenge is to illustrate this data structure in some creative way.
